React fundamentals

Components are (pages) to show for each URL path.

### Why are these imports required?

- **`BrowserRouter`**:  
  This component enables client-side routing using the browser's history API. It wraps your app and allows navigation without full page reloads.

- **`Routes`**:  
  This component is a container for all your route definitions. It matches the current URL to the correct `Route` child.

- **`Route`**:  
  Each `Route` defines a path and the component to render when the URL matches that path.
